                        Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the 
                        mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.

                        Ruby is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including 
                        procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. According to the creator, Ruby was influenced by 
                        Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, Basic, and Lisp.

                        As an open source language, Ruby has been ported to run
                        on many different computer platforms and architectures. 
                        This means that if you develop a Ruby program on one 
                        machine, it's likely you'll be able to run it without 
                        any changes on a different machine. You can use Ruby, 
                        in one form or another, on most operating systems and 
                        platforms.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are multiple ways to install and manage Ruby. If 
                        you are on Windows, the simplest way to get Ruby installed 
                        is by using the <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/">Ruby  
                        Installer for Windows</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can use any editor you like, as long as it's a 
                        plain-text editor (and not a word processor) and a 
                        directory (a.k.a. a folder) in which to store your Ruby 
                        program files. The folder is separate from other work 
                        areas so that you can keep track of your practice 
                        program files.

                        Variables are the memory locations, which hold any data to

                        There are five types of variables supported by Ruby. You

                        variables in the previous chapter as well. These five 
                        types of variables are explained in this chapter.

                    <p>
                        Constants begin with an uppercase letter. Constants defined 
                        within a class or module can be accessed from within that class 
                        or module, and those defined outside a class or module can 
                        be accessed globally.

                    <p>
                        Constants may not be defined within methods. Referencing 
                        an uninitialized constant produces an error. Making an 
                        assignment to a constant that is already initialized 
                        produces a warning.

                    <p>
                        Ruby has several data types. All data types are based on 
                        classes. The following are the data types recognized in 
                        Ruby:
                        <ul>                            
                            <li>Booleans</li>
                            <li>Symbols</li>
                            <li>Numbers</li>
                            <li>Strings</li>
                            <li>Arrays</li>
                            <li>Hashes</li>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Ruby the boolean data type can have one of the two 
                        values: true or false

                    <p>Symbols are used to represent other objects. Using symbols 
                        instead of strings may save some resources. A symbol is 
                        an instance object of a Symbol class. Symbols are generated 
                        by using an colon before an identifier, like :name. 
                        Several objects also have to_sym methods. These methods 
                        convert those objects to symbols.

                        Floating point numbers represent real numbers in computing. 
                        Real numbers measure continuous quantities like weight, 
                        height or speed. In Ruby, decimal numbers are objects 
                        of the Float or a BigDecimal class. The BigDecimal class, 
                        a Ruby core class, is part of Ruby's standard library. In 
                        addition, we can use Rational objects too.</p>

                        Arrays are ordered collections of objects. Hashes are 
                        collections of key-value pairs. We will have a single 
                        chapter for both arrays and hashes. The following example 
                        just gives a quick look at both containers.

                        Rails is a web application development framework written 
                        in the Ruby programming language. It is designed to make 
                        programming web applications easier by making assumptions 
                        about what every developer needs to get started. It 
                        allows you to write less code while accomplishing more 
                        than many other languages and frameworks. Experienced 
                        Rails developers also report that it makes web application 
                        development more fun.
